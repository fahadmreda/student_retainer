Description
-----------

Python/R-based program with GUI that uses data mining techniques (clustering/classification) to predict success/failure trends of
students based on course choices along with retention information.
Goals:
*   Identify common course taking patterns for first-time, full-time freshmen.
*   Predict student retention based on the identified course clusters and pre-existing risk factors.
*   Tools that can be used by academic advisors to better aid in enrollment decisions.

This program resulted from a class project in CS 5593 Data Mining from Fall 2016 at the University of Oklahoma.
